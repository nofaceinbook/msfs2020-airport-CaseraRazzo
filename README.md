Actually the mesh and scenery in MSFS are per default great and usable for this small strip. So you could fly there directly e.g. from Belluno (LIDB) or enter the following coordinates: "46.477098, 12.614290".
This scenery however adds runway, so that you could spawn there directly and adds some objects.

# Installation
Go to the latest release (refer to link on the right) and unzip the airport file into your MSFS 2020 Community Folder. 

# Credits
I was inspired by nicotom-xp who created this nice landing strip in X-Plane (https://forums.x-plane.org/index.php?/files/file/24728-casera-razzo-mountain-landing-strip-italy/) and he based it on a scenery started from the original FSX work by Dario "Vic Dabor" Bortot. So now it is back again in the newes MS sim :-)
